1219 is a Ruby on Rails application being developed for Refraction Arts 
( http://refractionarts.org/ ), as part of an upcoming installation called 
12:19. At this point, I'm not real clear on what 12:19 is all about, but I 
understand it involves user-contributed 'snapshots' of life between the 
minutes 12:19 and 12:20. These 'snapshots' may take the form of movies, 
audio, text, etc. The snapshots will be categorized by the artists in some 
library-derived organizational concept. That's all I was able to wrap my head 
around during by brief introduction to the project, but I was able to glean 
enough information to start on my part of the project: this application.

Basically, this application is a simple file uploader and categorizer. Users 
upload files, along with their name and a bit of info about themselves, and a 
name, description and tags for their uploaded content. The artists will have 
the ability to categorize or otherwise organize the uploaded content in 
preparation for their larger 12:19 project.
